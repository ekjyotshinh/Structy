1. Uncompress----->The uncompress method takes a compressed string as input and returns the uncompressed string. If a character is a digit, it increments j to continue scanning the number. If a non-digit character is encountered, it extracts the number from the substring. For ex, 3a2b4c --> aaabbcccc

2) Compress--------> The compress meathod takes in a uncompressed string and then converts that into a compresseed string, if the number appears only once then instead of 1 we just write the alphabet

3) Anagrams---------> Anagrams, takes in two strings as arguments. The funtion should return a boolean indicatring weather or not it is an anagram or not. Anagrams are strings that contain the same character, but in any order.

4) Most frequent Character------------> MostFrequentChar takes in a string as an argument. The function should return the most frequent character of the string. If there are ties, return the character that appears earlier in the string.
